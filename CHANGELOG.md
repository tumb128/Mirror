* NetworkClient.sendRate is now coupled to NetworkServer.sendRate in order to avoid snapshot interpolation errors where server & client may be on different send rates, components use the wrong rate to send vs. interpolate, etc. ([1176494](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/1176494587c2956f11ab7bf5f48576323652e02d))

* NetworkClient.Shutdown calls ClientScene.Shutdown again to properly clean up client scene. ClientScene only cleans up itself without touching transport or NetworkIdentities (fixes the bug where the player object wouldn't be destroyed after calling StopClient) ([fb716df](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/fb716df12997417ce41a063508937d68a75991bf))

* NetworkClient/Server: use the new custom NetworkLateUpdate instead of Unity's LateUpdate. fixes possible data races where other component's LateUpdate could be called before/after NetworkServer/Client LateUpdate causing non obvious data races. (#2604) ([43e6fb4](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/43e6fb4c5352c19d8e70ae61608463f58f86da10))

([d7fbee9](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/d7fbee9d5036d6246519354bc283e3984b3dd147))
* NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer is only set, but never reset. fixes a bug where isLocalPlayer would be false in OnDestroy, so some components couldn't rely on it in OnDestroy. fixes #2615 (this is also faster than comparing ClientScene.localPlayer each time) (#2616) ([a6f6f80](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/a6f6f80f65f7453d2a73690f5b6b62d9f77dc348))
* NetworkIdentity.isServer is only set, but never reset. fixes a bug where isServer would be false in OnDestroy, so some components couldn't rely on it in OnDestroy. fixes #2533 ([ee1f941](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/ee1f941290c06a6cfb450ce58b00a2a6b1b28fe4))
* NetworkIdentity.MaxNetworkBehaviours and EnsureMax function so we have the same code in both places, where previously Serialize() still checked for 255 instead of 64 ([9dd04e2](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/9dd04e2efad7ea2f377e5a07c89cae9dc7da121e))
* NetworkIdentity.OnStartLocalPlayer catches exceptions now too. fixes a potential bug where an exception in PlayerInventory.OnStartLocalPlayer would cause PlayerEquipment.OnStartLocalPlayer to not be called ([5ed5f84](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/5ed5f844090442e16e78f466f7a785881283fbd4))
* NetworkIdentity.RebuildObservers: added missing null check for observers coming from components that implement OnRebuildObservers. Previously this caused a NullReferenceException. ([a5f495a](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/a5f495a77485b972cf39f8a42bae6d7d852be38c))

* NetworkIdentity.SetClientOwner: overwriting the owner was still possible even though it shouldn't be. all caller functions double check and return early if it already has an owner, so we should do the same here. ([548db52](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/548db52fdf224f06ba9d8b2d75460d31181b7066))

* NetworkLoop inserts a fresh PlayerLoopSystem instead of resizing and overwriting partially. fixes undefined behaviour where the previous nativeLoop IntPtrs weren't cleared, possibly still updating a native loop accidentally. See also #2652 ([09bf1c5](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/09bf1c5bf0ecdeda4f0aaa195a1486bb11d3fba6))

* NetworkManager now always applies the exposed NetworkServer.send/tickRate. fixes a bug where some NetworkBehaviours may try to send with NetworkServer.tickRate, which wouldn't be available on client because NetworkManager.StartServer was never called, so the rate was never set. ([8d3d623](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/8d3d623fac6a12e3974593d25e7f8d8b74558783))

* NetworkServer.OnConnected allows for connectionIds < 0 now. some transports like kcp use hashing where connectionIds can easily be < 0, which previously was not allowed. ([12ee96f](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/12ee96f5d940f6564f99a1048922e12f6fb2599b))

* NetworkServer.OnDisconnected removed. There is only one way to invoke the disconnect handling, which is OnTransportDisconnected. fixes bugs where OnDisconnect would handle the disconnect, not remove the connection, then the Transport callback would call OnTransportDisconnected->OnDisconnect a second time. fixes #2706 and many more ([007dd80](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/007dd80852956153f702ab0dbdc6a2acbc9ef037))

* NetworkServer/Client don't use Connect/DisconnectMessage anymore. fixes a bug where external connects could try sending that message causing undefined behaviour (#2577) ([be42976](https://www.github.com/tumb128/Mirror/commit/be42976a26fcc48537f6f9adcc4c2737ddcd4aab))
